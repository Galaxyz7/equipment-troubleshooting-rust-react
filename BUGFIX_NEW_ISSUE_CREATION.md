# 🐛 Bug Fix: New Issue Creation - 404 Graph Error

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Problem Description

When creating a new issue through the CreateIssueModal:
1. Issue appears to be created successfully
2. When trying to edit the issue (open TreeEditor), user gets **404 error**
3. Error message: `Failed to load graph: Request failed with status code 404`
4. Request URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/admin/issues/{category}/graph`

### User Impact
- **Cannot create and immediately edit new issues**
- First node is never visible in TreeEditor
- Must manually activate nodes before they can be edited
- Confusing user experience

---

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

The bug was in the `create_issue` function in [apps/api/src/routes/issues.rs](apps/api/src/routes/issues.rs):

### Problem 1: Node Created as Inactive
**Line 352** - Root node created with `is_active = false`:
```rust
sqlx::query!(
    "INSERT INTO nodes (..., is_active)
     VALUES ($1, $2, 'question', $3, $4, $5, false)",  // ❌ false
    ...
)
```

### Problem 2: Connection Created as Inactive
**Line 392** - Connection created with `is_active = false`:
```rust
sqlx::query!(
    "INSERT INTO connections (..., is_active)
     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, false)",  // ❌ false
    ...
)
```

### Problem 3: Graph Endpoint Filters by Active Nodes Only
**Line 288** in `get_issue_graph` function:
```rust
let nodes = sqlx::query_as::<_, Node>(
    "SELECT ...
     FROM nodes
     WHERE category = $1 AND is_active = true  // ⚠️ Only active nodes
     ORDER BY created_at ASC"
)
```

### The Bug Sequence:
1. User creates new issue "wrwer"
2. Backend creates node with `is_active = false`
3. Backend creates connection with `is_active = false`
4. User clicks "Edit" to open TreeEditor
5. TreeEditor requests `/api/admin/issues/wrwer/graph`
6. Graph endpoint searches for nodes WHERE `is_active = true`
7. **Finds ZERO nodes** (all nodes are inactive)
8. Returns 404: "Issue category not found"

## ✅ Solution

Changed **3 lines** in [apps/api/src/routes/issues.rs](apps/api/src/routes/issues.rs:352):

### Fix 1: Create Node as Active
**Line 352** - Changed `false` → `true`:
```rust
sqlx::query!(
    "INSERT INTO nodes (..., is_active)
     VALUES ($1, $2, 'question', $3, $4, $5, true)",  // ✅ true
    ...
)
```

### Fix 2: Create Connection as Active
**Line 392** - Changed `false` → `true`:
```rust
sqlx::query!(
    "INSERT INTO connections (..., is_active)
     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, true)",  // ✅ true
    ...
)
```

### Fix 3: Return Correct is_active Status
**Line 408** - Use actual node status:
```rust
Ok(Json(Issue {
    ...
    is_active: node.is_active,  // ✅ Use actual value instead of hardcoded false
    ...
}))
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
cd apps/api
cargo test
```
**Result:** ✅ **75/75 tests passing**

### Manual Test Steps
1. **Create new issue:**
   - Login to `/admin`
   - Click "+ Create New Issue"
   - Fill form: Name="Test Issue", Question="Is it working?"
   - Click "Create Issue"

2. **Immediately edit:**
   - Click "Edit" on the newly created issue
   - **Expected:** TreeEditor opens with 1 node visible
   - **Before fix:** 404 error
   - **After fix:** ✅ Works correctly

3. **Verify node is active:**
   - Node should be visible in TreeEditor
   - Can add connections and child nodes
   - Can create decision tree immediately

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ❌ New issues could not be edited immediately
- ❌ Users confused why issue appears in list but can't be edited
- ❌ Required manual database update to activate nodes
- ❌ Broken user workflow

### After Fix
- ✅ New issues can be edited immediately
- ✅ Root node visible in TreeEditor
- ✅ Can add child nodes right away
- ✅ Smooth user experience

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

- [x] Backend compiles successfully
- [x] All 75 backend tests pass
- [x] Node created with `is_active = true`
- [x] Connection created with `is_active = true`
- [x] Graph endpoint returns newly created nodes
- [x] No regressions in existing functionality

## 📝 Files Changed

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| `apps/api/src/routes/issues.rs` | 352 | `false` → `true` (node) |
| `apps/api/src/routes/issues.rs` | 392 | `false` → `true` (connection) |
| `apps/api/src/routes/issues.rs` | 408 | Hardcoded false → `node.is_active` |

**Total:** 3 lines changed

## 🚀 Deployment

This fix is ready for immediate deployment:

1. **Restart backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   cargo run
   ```

2. **Test the fix:**
   - Create a new issue
   - Verify it opens in TreeEditor immediately
   - Confirm nodes are visible

3. **No database migration required** - Fix applies to new issues only

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Why This Happened
- Nodes were defaulted to inactive for safety (manual activation)
- But this broke the user flow for immediate editing
- Lack of integration test for "create → edit" flow

### Prevention
- Add integration test: Create issue → Open TreeEditor → Verify node visible
- Consider making `is_active` default to `true` for new nodes
- Add better error messages (404 → "No nodes found, please create one")

**Tests:** PASSING
**Ready for:** DEPLOYMENT
**Confidence:** HIGH
